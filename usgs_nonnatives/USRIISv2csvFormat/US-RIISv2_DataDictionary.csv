All names are species rank or below.","text","Aira caryophyllea var. caryophyllea; Banana bunchy top virus; Festuca rubra ssp. fallax; Mentha X piperita","Required on MasterList. From Darwin Core, but no name authorship is included. Note that hybrid names use the capital letter X (not the times symbol) and subspecies is abbreviated ssp. (not subsp.)."
"scientificNameAuthorship","The authorship information for the scientificName formatted according to the conventions of the applicable nomenclaturalCode. Note this value is especially important where a name is ambiguous.","text","(Beer, 1954); Fain 1973","Optional on MasterList. Compatible with Darwin Core. New field, not in this dataset's predecessor."
"vernacularName","Common name, generally in English, for the taxon. Not uniquely assigned and may be misleading, i.e. ""Argid sawfly"" is a wasp, not a fly. The first letter of the first word and any proper names are capitalized.","text","Abutilon; bristlegrass; European pine shooter; Costa Rica night blooming cactus","Required on MasterList. From Darwin Core. In this dataset's predecessor, this field was called ""Common Name"". Derived in one of many ways: provided by the Authority; suggested by expert reviewer; chosen from an internet search; or, a generic description of the taxonomic group (generally genus or family level)."
"taxonRank","The relative level of the taxon within its taxonomic hierarchy.","text","Controlled vocabulary: Species, Subspecies, Variety, Form, Unranked","Required on MasterList. From Darwin Core. New field, not in this dataset's predecessor. Previously used term ""Hybrid"" (for hybrids not taxonomically recognized) has been replaced by ""Unranked""; note that most hybrids are taxonRank = Species."
"establishmentMeans","New term. Describes whether species was introduced by human activity, or if known, purposely introduced. In this dataset, other possible terms described in Darwin Core do not apply.","text","Controlled vocabulary - definition: introduced (alien, exotic, non-native, nonindigenous) - Establishment of a taxon by human agency into an area that is not part of its natural range; introduced: assisted colonization - Establishment of a taxon specifically with the intention of creating a self-sustaining wild population in an area that is not part of the taxon's natural range.","Required on MasterList. Currently 2 terms in use. Previously, more than 11 terms have been used in this field.

"degreeOfEstablishment","Formerly called ""Introduced or Invasive"". Describes the kind of presence in the locality for the species and the degree to which an Organism survives, reproduces, and expands its range at the given place and time.

Reproduction occurring, and population self-sustaining; invasive (category D2) - Self-sustaining population outside of captivity or cultivation, that causes or is likely to cause harm; widespread invasive (category E) - invasive with individuals dispersing, surviving and reproducing at multiple sites across a spectrum of habitats and geographic range.","Required on MasterList. Use of the term widespread invasive (category E) in the dataset is still under development and may be incompletely portrayed. Note that in this dataset the term ""invasive"" connotates harmful or likely to cause harm."
"isHybrid","New term. Flag indicating a hybrid organism. This does not have to be reflected in the name, but can be based on other studies like chromosome numbers.","text","Controlled vocabulary - definition: TRUE - affirmative; FALSE - negative","Required on MasterList. From https://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/gna:isHybrid; NOTE: due to the manual nature of deriving this field's value, it is prone to human error; e.g., some hybrid names may mistakenly carry the value FALSE."
"pathway","New term. Provides information about the process by which an Organism came to be in a given place at a given time. As per the Convention on Biological Diversity (https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/9d85/3bc5/d640f059d03acd717602cd76/sbstta-22-inf-09-en.pdf)","text","Controlled vocabulary: agriculture (including biofuel feedstocks) | angling/fishing equipment | aquaculture/mariculture | biological control | botanic garden/zoo/aquaria (excluding domestic aquaria) | conservation or wildlife management | container/bulk | contaminant nursery material | contaminant on animals (except parasites, organisms transported by host/vector) | contaminant on plants (except parasites, species transported by host/vector) | contaminated bait | corridor | corridor and dispersal | erosion control | escape from confinement | farmed animals (including animals left under limited control) | fishery in the wild | food contaminant (including of live food) | forestry (including reforestation) | fur farms | hitchhikers in or on airplane | hitchhikers on ship/boat (excluding ballast water and hull fouling) | horticulture | hunting | intentional | interconnected waterways/basins/seas | landscape improvement | live food and live bait | machinery/equipment | natural dispersal across borders of invasive alien organisms | organic packing material, in particular wood packaging | ornamental purpose other than horticulture | other escape from confinement | other intentional release | other means of transport | parasites on animals (including organisms transported by host and vector) | parasites on plants (including species transported by host and vector) | pathway concept scheme | people and their luggage/equipment (in particular tourism) | pet/aquarium/terrarium species (including live food for such species) | release in nature | released for use | research and ex-situ breeding (in facilities) | seed contaminant | ship/boat ballast water | ship/boat hull fouling | timber trade | transport-contaminant | transport-stowaway | transportation of habitat material (soil, vegetation, wood etc.) | tunnels and land bridges | unaided | unintentional | vehicles (car, train, etc.)","Optional on MasterList. Because the controlled vocabulary at https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/9d85/3bc5/d640f059d03acd717602cd76/sbstta-22-inf-09-en.pdf is very detailed, using the appropriate umbrella term is also acceptable: Release in nature | Escape from confinement | Transport - contaminant | Transport - stowaway | Corridor | Unaided; Note: use of the term 'unaided' in this database implies that human-influenced changes such as desertification or deforestation enabled the species to move into areas beyond its natural range, and so is considered indirect assistance."

If a derived value is required, these rules are followed: Remove approximation symbol (~) to get exact year. When date range is provided, choose the middle year, rounding up. E.g. 1990s = 1995, 18th century = 1750, 1968-1971 = 1970, 2000s = 2005. When ""before"", ""prior to"", or a lesser than symbol are used, subtract 5 years.
