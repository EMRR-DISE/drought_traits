Deprecated ver. 1.0 and its associated files, in addition to being accessible through https://doi.org/10.5066/P92DN8D8, are also downloadable from DOI https://doi.org/10.5066/P95XL09Q, individually or as a bundled .zip file. 
NOTE: These files should only be used for comparative purposes with the newest version of the database.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
The US-RIIS decreased in size overall, due to the removal of synonyms, eradications, and errors (species not established or species actually native). The AK list grew by 2%, the HI shrank by 7%, and the L48 list shrank by 2%, although 309 new records were added to all lists. In updating the ver 2.0 list, 1,025 ver. 1.0 records were removed. There were 72 records removed as eradicated (53 from HI and 19 from L48). There were 45 failed introductions that were removed from the list (42 from HI and 3 from L48). The largest number of removed records, 413, were accidental introductions incorrectly assumed to be established (2 from AK, 194 from HI, and 217 from L48). There were 120 species removed because they were subsequently determined to be native to the locality (110 from HI and 10 from L48). There were 340 records removed because they were found to synonymous with existing records (3 from AK, 190 from HI, and 147 from L48). There were 34 records removed as misidentifications, 26 from HI and 8 from L48).
There were 456 records added to the unofficial watchlist, of which 296 were removed from US-RIIS and 160 were obtained elsewhere, especially from the PestLens Newsletter. The watchlist and/or the deletions document are available upon request from us-riis@usgs.gov.

ADDITIONAL NOTES OF CLARIFICATION ON VER. 2.0:

Establishment (best described in the degreeOfEstablishment field)
We define 'established' as maintaining a breeding population in the location. Expert reviewers found scores of records where the cited authorities incorrectly asserted taxa are established.  These records were removed from the list and added to the unofficial informal watch list (which is available upon request from us-riis@usgs.gov). Where appropriate, we have also added the comment "Under eradication" to the occurrenceRemarks field of some records. There were also many records that are actually native and so removed.

Taxonomy
The taxonomy of many names has changed and continues to do so, and some names were disputed or misspelled. GBIF now provides the taxonomic backbone to the list, with ITIS as a secondary resource, and several other taxonomic authorities also cited. Where synonymies emerged or misspellings were encountered, records were edited and junior synonyms added to the taxonRemarks field, reducing the total number of records on the list. Redundant trinomials were excluded where there were no other related trinomials found in the locality. (For example, if only Poa annua and Poa annua annua are established in a region, one name, usually the trinomial, was removed as redundant.) 

Corrections and Additions
Please email any input you have to help improve the list to us at us-riis@usgs.gov. We welcome your input and are always seeking expert reviewers and coauthors for future updates.
